Andreas,

The script is inside my "pycurrents" Python package, so it can't simply be pulled out as a standalone:

https://currents.soest.hawaii.edu/hgstage/pycurrents/file/tip/pycurrents/scripts/ldeo_to_cdf.py

It imports functionality from 3 modules in pycurrents.

(The code is also messy, not an example of good Python.  It could use a thorough going-over with some refactoring and reformatting.)
